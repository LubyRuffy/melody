Welcome to the ~Melodoc~.

Melody is an internet sensor built for threat intelligence. This tool have multiple uses :

+ Build historic data to extract trends and patterns 
+ Keep an eye on specific threats
+ Monitor emerging threats exploitation
+ Index malicious activity by detecting exploitation attempts and targeted scanners
+ Put it in front of your application to get easily parsable data about malicious activity it receives

Deploying it can be as easy as pulling the latest compiled binary, adding your favorite rules and mixing it with a `config.yml` file to customize it to your needs. You can then forget it[^1] and let the melody of the internet flow to you.

Melody will handle log rotation for you. It can run forever on the lightest VPS.

[^1]: You should either setup an automated patching process or come back often to apply security patches on the host though
